This repository will be a Go-based implementation of the extracted, reassembled and rebuilt ROM from my [Retro Defender](https://github.com/jeffnyman/retro-defender) project.

This is a Go project, so all you should have to do once you have [Go installed on your system](https://go.dev/dl/) is:

```sh
go build
```

That will generate a `defender-reblabel.exe` file.
